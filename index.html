        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            This experiment's purpose is to test the effectiveness of different types of data visualizations in encoding numeric values. More specifically this experiment tests how easily a person can compare the area encodings of regular treemaps compared to voronoi treemaps, and compared to bubble charts. A bar chart visualization is also included as a base line comparison. By measuring participant's accuracy in reading these charts, we can better understand which visualizations are more effective in relaying numeric information that is encoding in these area charts.
        </p>
        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <p>
            One trial will go through 80 runs. Each run will display one of the four types of visualizations (bar chart, treemap, voronoi treemap, and bubble chart). There will be six valued encoded in these visualizations, all ranging from 1-100. Two of the encoded values will clearly be marked by dots. As the participant you are tasked with deciding what percentage the smaller of the two values is of the larger value. In other words if one of the selected values looked to be half as much as the other you would enter 50 representing 50% (enter whole numbers without percent sign, entering 23 would equate to a guess of 23%). After yoy enter a value the next visualization will be shown, and this will repeat 80 times. At the end of the experiment a csv will be downloaded that you can access which will show the stats for the trial.
